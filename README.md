# ai-traffic-signal-optimizer
Smart traffic signal system using computer vision, adaptive logic, and emergency prioritization
# AI Traffic Signal Optimiser 🚦

This project is a smart traffic signal control system for a single 4-way intersection.

It uses:
- Computer Vision to estimate live traffic density
- Adaptive logic to change signal timings dynamically
- Emergency prioritization for ambulances
- Normal mode fallback when traffic is balanced

## Features
- Live vehicle count per lane
- Automatic mode switching (Normal / Smart)
- Emergency override
- Web-based live dashboard

## Tech Stack
- Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV
- FastAPI + WebSockets
- React
- Free cloud deployment

## Status
🚧 Under active development (IEEE Mega Project 8.0)
